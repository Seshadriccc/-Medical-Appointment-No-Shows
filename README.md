## Overview

This project analyzes medical appointment data to understand patterns and factors that influence patient no-show behavior. Using a dataset of medical appointments, we investigate what characteristics make patients more likely to miss their scheduled appointments.

## Project Objectives

The main goals of this analysis are to:

- **Identify key factors** that contribute to appointment no-shows
- **Analyze patient demographics** and their relationship to attendance patterns  
- **Examine appointment characteristics** such as scheduling patterns, lead times, and days of the week
- **Provide actionable insights** for healthcare providers to reduce no-show rates
- **Create visualizations** to communicate findings effectively

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about medical appointments with the following key features:

### Patient Information
- **PatientId**: Unique identifier for each patient
- **Gender**: Patient gender (Male/Female)
- **Age**: Patient age at time of appointment
- **Neighbourhood**: Location/district of the patient

### Medical Conditions
- **Scholarship**: Whether patient is enrolled in Brazilian welfare program
- **Hypertension**: Whether patient has hypertension (Yes/No)
- **Diabetes**: Whether patient has diabetes (Yes/No)  
- **Alcoholism**: Whether patient has alcohol dependency (Yes/No)
- **Handicap**: Disability level (0-4 scale)

### Appointment Details
- **AppointmentID**: Unique identifier for each appointment
- **ScheduledDay**: Date when appointment was scheduled
- **AppointmentDay**: Date of the actual appointment
- **SMS_received**: Whether patient received SMS reminder (Yes/No)
- **No-show**: Target variable - whether patient showed up (Yes = No-show, No = Showed up)

## Key Research Questions

1. What is the overall no-show rate in the dataset?
2. How do patient demographics (age, gender) affect no-show probability?
3. Does the time between scheduling and appointment date impact attendance?
4. Which medical conditions are associated with higher/lower no-show rates?
5. How effective are SMS reminders in reducing no-shows?
6. Are there specific days of the week or times with higher no-show rates?
7. Does neighbourhood/location influence appointment attendance?

## Analysis Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and data inconsistencies
- Create derived features (appointment lead time, day of week, etc.)
- Encode categorical variables for analysis
- Remove outliers and invalid data points

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Calculate overall no-show statistics
- Analyze distributions of key variables
- Create cross-tabulations between features and no-show rates
- Generate correlation matrices for numerical variables

### Statistical Analysis
- Perform chi-square tests for categorical relationships
- Conduct t-tests for numerical variable comparisons
- Calculate confidence intervals for key metrics
- Apply statistical significance testing

### Visualization
- Create bar charts for categorical comparisons
- Generate histograms for numerical distributions  
- Build heatmaps for correlation analysis
- Design time series plots for temporal patterns

## Key Findings

*[This section will be populated after analysis is complete]*

### Demographics Impact
- Age group analysis and no-show patterns
- Gender differences in appointment attendance
- Neighbourhood effects on show rates

### Medical Conditions
- Chronic condition impact on attendance
- Relationship between multiple conditions and reliability

### Scheduling Factors  
- Optimal lead time between scheduling and appointment
- Day of week effects on attendance
- SMS reminder effectiveness

## Expected Outcomes

This analysis will provide healthcare administrators with:

- **Quantified risk factors** for appointment no-shows
- **Demographic insights** for targeted intervention strategies  
- **Operational recommendations** for scheduling optimization
- **Evidence-based suggestions** for reminder systems
- **Data-driven policies** to improve patient attendance

## Business Impact

Understanding no-show patterns can help healthcare providers:
